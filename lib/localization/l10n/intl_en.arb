  "informationResourceUsesRT": "On the information resource, when using information technologies for providing information, the collection, systematization and analysis of information related to the preferences of Internet users located on the territory of the Russian Federation is carried out.",
  "providingInformationRT": "Recommendation technologies are information technologies for providing information based on the collection, systematization and analysis of information related to the preferences of Internet users (hereinafter referred to as “recommendations”).",
  "questionsAboutRecommendations": "In these Rules, we will answer basic questions about what recommendations are, the recommendation system (hereinafter referred to as the “system”) and how they work on AliExpress.",
  "whatRecommendationSystem": "What is a recommendation system?",
  "modernToolRS": "The Easy Shoppin recommendation system is a modern tool that helps users easily find products that interest them. The system is responsible for finding candidate products that are relevant for each specific context on a site or application, as well as the logic for sorting and displaying these products.",
  "productsGeneratedRS": "The recommendations themselves on Easy Shoppin are a selection of products generated by the recommendation system; they can be located in various places on the website and in the AliExpress application.",
  "whatRecommendations": "What are the recommendations?",
  "personalProductRecommendations": "There are two types of recommendations on Easy Shoppin: personal and product. Personalized recommendations analyze the user's purchase history and recently viewed products. Such recommendations can be seen on the AliExpress home page, in the user profile or, for example, on the pages of active orders or order details.",
  "productRecommendationsHelp": "Product recommendations help the user find offers similar to the one selected. This is done so that the user can find alternatives and compare options. An example of such recommendations can be found on the product card or in a non-empty cart.",
  "whatStagesRecommendations": "What stages does the system go through before making recommendations to the user?",
  "selectionProductsThrough": "Before the user sees a selection of products, the system goes through the following stages: searching for candidate products → ranking products → building the logic for displaying products.",
  "searchCandidateProducts": "Stage 1. Search for candidate products",
  "systemSelectsProductsRelevant": "At this stage, the system selects M products relevant to the context from a large number of products N. If the context is a product card, then candidate products are selected based on the product on this card, in the cart - based on the list of products in the cart. Thus, for product recommendations, products from the same categories or similar ones as the main product are selected. At the same time, we believe that the more often products from any categories fall into one purchase, the more these categories suit each other.",
  "personalizedRecommendations": "To make personalized recommendations, we take into account information about any user interaction with products (for example, clicks, purchases or views) and select products based on these interactions.",
  "likelihoodBecomingProduct": "The likelihood of becoming a product candidate is higher if more similar users clicked on a product.",
  "productRanking": "Stage 2. Product ranking",
  "relevantProductsRanks": "At this stage, the system selects the most relevant products and ranks them according to the likelihood of purchase by the user. Machine learning models are used for this. As a result, each product is given a score from 0 to 1. The higher the score, the higher the position the product occupies in the recommendations.",
  "variousProductProperties": "The model is based on various product properties, such as views, clicks, orders, ratings, price and much more. Using the gradient boosting method of decision trees, the model predicts the probability of purchase for each product. Different properties may have different weights for the model, for example, price may be more important than the number of views.",
  "likelihoodPurchasingProduct": "The likelihood of purchasing a product will differ for different contexts; the same product may have a high rating on the main page of the site and a lower rating on the order history page.",
  "modelAnalyzesUser": "The model analyzes user behavior in the past, understands what products were of interest to him or users with similar preferences, and predicts what a person will be willing to buy. Recommendations are most strongly influenced by products that the user has purchased on AliExpress before.",
  "logicDisplayingSelection": "Stage 3. Logic for displaying a selection of recommendations",
  "businessLogicDisplaying": "At this stage, the business logic for displaying a selection and filtering products is applied.",
  "receivedFinalRatings": "When the system has received all the final ratings, a selection is formed in which products with a higher rating are shown higher in the search results, and products with a lower rating are shown closer to the end. When a selection of products is formed, the main characteristics of each product are loaded (price, discounts, cashback, delivery, etc.) and images.",
  "selectionRecommendations": "A selection of recommendations may show a different number of products depending on their location on the AliExpress website or app. Depending on the type and location of the recommendations, they can be positioned horizontally, with side swipes, or vertically, loading additional products as the user scrolls to the end of the recommendations. We hope our recommendation system will help you find the best products and make your AliExpress journey more fun and convenient!",
